# sedit

sedit is a terminal text editor that aims to improve nano. Nano is a nice, easy to use editor, but lacks a few things. sedit strives to remedy these problems. While development is done on Windows, the sole dependency ``ncurses`` (except from libc) enables cross-compatibility for every platform that supports it.

## Roadmap

- In-editor configuration
- Multi-file support
- Color schemes (if supported by the OS)
- ... and much more!
